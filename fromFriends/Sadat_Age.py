s = """ I have always had a great passion for science. From the very beginning of my school life, I found mathematics and science really intriguing. As I grew up, my affection towards them increased. 

I come from Bangladesh which is a country that does have an educational system to get along. But it is missing a crucial factor of education which is called "True Learning". We are taught how to pass exams for a short-term success and I am not a fan of that. 

In middle-school, I got two friends just like me. We started to do some extra study after school everyday. Internet was the main source of our knowledge, but most of the time we used to solve problems with critical thinking. And every night after completing our institutional tasks, I used to think about the topics I learnt more deeply, just hoping to find something new. We called it 'Research', which turned out to be pretty useful for us. I rediscovered some of the mathematical formulas before I knew about them. We got better at problem solving and theoretical Physics.

The first year of high was mostly academic learning, but at least I made a good base in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics.

Then the pandemic struck. Our school didn't have much activity. But I would say that I made the most of it as I had a lot of free time to study what I want to study finally. I finished some courses of mathematics, including Linear Algebra, Number Theory (mosty Complex Numbers), Calculus and Multi-dimensional Vectors. I learned the basics of Relativity,Â  did some research on Quantum Mechanics and main-stream String Theory. I have a locally published theory about quantum dark field, simply named "The Dark Field Theory". 

Then I got addicted to software development. First, I just learned to code in Python3 to get some ease at my mathematical works. Then I learned HTML5-CSS-JS to help my friends create websites. But mostly did the work in Python. I do not have a computer, but I have a tablet to get the work done. One of my greatest success in programming with Python is that I managed to create my own graphical interface because other pre-made modules didn't work on my tablet. 


So, I would say that I am hard working when I like the work, very much lazy when I don't. I like to use my learnings in real life. But I think what's nice is that I like to generalize everything in the universe and figure out the connections, patterns and limits which are meant to be broken.

I think that a better education and scope for free-learning can enable me to utilize my full potential.
